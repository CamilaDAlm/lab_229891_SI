#Lab2 

#After following the slides of the lab, I have implemented the next features:

#I added audio when the sheeps fall or are hit by the player.

#I also did a UI to see the score of the player.

#I added a UI to have an start page that leads to starting the game or to quit it.Also, the
#buttons of the UI have change in colour when hovering.

#Finally, I created some variants of the sheep with the following characteristics:
	
	#Wood sheep: Discounts 2 points when hit since it is not a real sheep.
        #Cyan sheep: Rewards with 2 points when hit and sustracts 1 from the fallen sheep 	discount.
        #Magenta sheep: Rewards with 3 points when hit but discounts 2 when falls.
